about: >
  Hi, I'm a third-year B.Sc. Computer Science and Data Analytics student at IIT Patna with a strong passion for data science and machine learning. I enjoy exploring data, finding patterns, and turning raw information into meaningful insights.

  I’ve worked on projects like a Fake News Detection system using Explainable AI (deployed with Streamlit), and built web apps combining data analysis and UI design. I’m confident in Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, and I’m looking for real-world data science internships to grow my skills.

projects: >
  1. **Fake News Detection with Explainable AI**  
     Built using Python, Scikit-learn, SHAP, and Streamlit. It classifies real/fake news with interpretable output using SHAP values. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/Karan-veer10/fake-news-detector.git)

  2. **3D Portfolio Website (In Progress)**  
     A fully responsive portfolio site with HTML/CSS/JS and Three.js animations. Includes animated sections like Skills, Projects, Certifications, and Contact.
